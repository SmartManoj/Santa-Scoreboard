# Santa Scoreboard

A scoreboard website for the Kaggle Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge, displaying individual task scores and total score.

## 📁 Files

- **index.html** - Main HTML structure
- **styles.css** - Styling and responsive design
- **script.js** - JavaScript for loading scores, filtering tasks, and displaying results
- **submission.csv** - Competition submission file
- **calculate_scores.py** - Python script to calculate individual task scores and total score using the official metric
- **task_scores.csv** - Generated CSV file with task-by-task scores (generated by calculate_scores.py)

## 🎨 Customization

You can customize the website by editing:

- **index.html** - Update content, add sections, modify structure
- **styles.css** - Change colors, fonts, spacing (CSS variables in `:root`)
- **script.js** - Modify data loading and display logic

## 📊 Competition Details

- **200 tasks** across the competition (001-200)
- Each task requires optimal placement and rotation of Christmas trees
- Submission file contains 20,100 entries with coordinates (x, y) and rotation degrees
- **Total Score**: 83.031685401301 (calculated using official metric)

## 🎯 Metric Details

The competition metric evaluates:
- **Normalized bounding box area** for each task
- Lower scores indicate more compact packing
- Each tree is a polygon shape that can be rotated
- Bounding box must contain the entire rotated tree polygon

## 🧮 Score Calculation

To calculate individual task scores and total score:

```bash
python calculate_scores.py
```

This will:
- Load the submission.csv file
- Group entries by task ID (001-200)
- Calculate scores for each task using the official competition metric
- Account for tree polygon geometry and rotations
- Generate `task_scores.csv` with results
- Display summary statistics with 12 decimal place precision

### Metric Implementation

The script implements the official competition metric:
- **Formula**: score = Σ(s²/n) for all tasks
- **s** = side length of square bounding box containing all trees
- **n** = number of trees in the configuration
- Uses actual tree polygon geometry (not simple circles)
- Accounts for tree rotations

The metric uses the tree polygon shape with:
- Trunk: 0.15 width × 0.2 height
- Base tier: 0.7 width
- Middle tier: 0.4 width
- Top tier: 0.25 width
- Tip at y = 0.8

The website automatically loads and displays scores from `task_scores.csv` when available.

## 🌐 Website Features

- **Total Score Display**: Shows total score with 12 decimal places
- **Task Scores Table**: Displays all 200 tasks with individual scores
- **Filter Functionality**: Filter tasks by:
  - Single task ID (e.g., "001", "100")
  - Range (e.g., "100-200")
  - Multiple IDs (e.g., "001 050 100" or "001,050,100")
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop devices
